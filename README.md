<p></p>

# Synopsis:
* Engine will be made with lightwieght JSON parser GOJSONQ
* JSON data will serve as makeshift database (easy to compile)
* Only using golang templates as frontend (again, easy of use) with minimalist design
* Go everything for learning purposes

## Notes:
- Abandonded Bleve for now. Too robust for proof-of-concept

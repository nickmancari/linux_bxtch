<p align='center'> ---Linux Bitch is a VERY lightweight linux distro search engine written in Go--- </p>

<p></p>

# Synopsis:
* Engine will be made with Bleve (fast and easy to use with indexing builtin)
* JSON data will serve as makeshift database (easy to compile)
* Only using golang templates as frontend (again, easy of use) with minimalist design
* Go everything for learning purposes

# Notes:
- So far, Bleve only plays well with go.13

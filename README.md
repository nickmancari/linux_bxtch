<p align='center'> -Linux Bitch is a VERY lightweight linux distro search engine written in Go- </p>

<p></p>

# Synopsis:
* Engine will be made with lightwieght JSON (fast) parser GOJSONQ
* JSON data will serve as makeshift database (easy to compile)
* Only using golang templates as frontend for speed and minimalist design
* Go everything for learning purposes

## Notes:
- Abandonded Bleve for now. Too robust for proof-of-concept
- Need to tweak search input variable to take upper and lower case variations

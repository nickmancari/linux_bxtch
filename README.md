<p align='center'> -Linux Bitch is a VERY lightweight linux distro search engine written in Go- </p>

# Synopsis:
* JSON data will serve as makeshift database for now (easy to compile)
* Only using Go html/templates as frontend for speed and minimalist design
* Go everything for learning purposes

## Notes:
- Solidify JSON data structure to serve results easier and more dynamically
- Need to tweak search input variable to take upper and lower case variations
- Search and serve now functioning with Go templates
- Integrate OS icons (add to the result table, make linkable, etc...)
- Using map instead of struct for now
- [ ] Multi-result query
